          <p><strong>PRAXI Network</strong> is an established technology transfer organization with long-standing
            experience in assisting SMEs and research organisations throughout Greece to achieve cross-border
            technological cooperation. It is a distinct administrative unit operating within the Foundation for Research
            and Technology – Hellas (FORTH), the most active research organisation of Greece. It started out in 1991 as
            a partnership between FORTH and SEV Hellenic Federation of Enterprises with the mission to link industry
            with academia. This strategic alliance of the research and industrial world of Greece was reinforced four
            years later, when the Federation of Industries of Northern Greece (FING) joined the partnership.</p>

          <p>Between 1995 and 2008, PRAXI Network was nominated by the European Commission as one of Europe’s Innovation
            Relay Centers (IRC) acting therefore as one of the main Greek stakeholders in the field of technological
            innovation and cross-border technological cooperation. In parallel and since 1999, the General Secretariat
            for Research & Technology in Greece appoints PRAXI Network as the National Contact Point (NCP) for the 5th,
            6th and 7th Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development and currently Horizon 2020,
            rendering it an official entity for information and advisory support for EU-funded research programmes.</p>

          <p>Since 2008, PRAXI Network provides innovation and technology transfer services, initially as a member and
            currently as coordinator of the Greek consortium of the Enterprise Europe Network, the largest network of
            integrated business support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).</p>
