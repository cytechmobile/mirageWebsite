                <p>
                    The Internet is a network of autonomous networks / systems that are interconnected in order to
                    provide communication services to end users (individuals, businesses, public organizations),
                    communicating with each other to route information packets. This communication is implemented at the
                    control plane level with the BGP protocol, based on which the policies of incoming and outgoing
                    packet flows are applied to each network through the announcement and selection of paths to Internet
                    address areas (IP prefixes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    BGP was designed without inherent security mechanisms (e.g. authentication) of the exchanged data
                    routing information. Such a serious shortcoming often leads (for decades now) to attacks known as
                    "BGP prefix hijacking", where one or more networks, either due to human error or (malicious) intent,
                    report false routing information. This information is disseminated throughout the Internet via the
                    BGP and leads to the redirection of data to invalid destinations, where they may be subject to
                    destruction (and interruption of relevant services), interception and/or alteration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The available defence mechanisms against such attacks either act in advance, based on the
                    authentication of routing information (RPKI, BGPsec, etc.), or take place after the event (detection
                    and non-automated response). Ex-ante defense mechanisms are usually limited and ineffective. In
                    particular, they require implementation by most networks, compliance with central certification
                    authorities, as well as changes to the BGP, requirements that have historically been extremely
                    difficult to achieve. Ex-post detection and response systems are delayed and/or require third
                    parties to operate and maintain them properly. It often takes hours or even days to recover the full
                    functionality of a network after such attacks, resulting in immeasurable financial losses. For
                    example, in 2018, for hours, half the population of Japan was left without Internet access due to a
                    misconfiguration of the Google network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope of the “MIRAGE” project (Mitigation of Internet Routing Attacks Globally and Efficiently)
                    is to develop an advanced system based on new features and services around the ARTEMIS open-source
                    tool, developed by FORTH's INSPIRE research team. ARTEMIS aims to monitor the level of control of
                    the Internet and the accurate and complete detection of BGP prefix hijacking attacks. A key
                    advantage of ARTEMIS is that it significantly reduces detection-response time from hours or days to
                    seconds, as confirmed by real-world experiments, making it state-of-the-art internationally among
                    the respective protection services available. The results of the implementation of the basic version
                    of ARTEMIS have been published in leading scientific journals (IEEE / ACM Transactions on
                    Networking) and have attracted the interest of international media and blogs from reputable bodies
                    (APNIC, IBM). It has also been adopted by network interconnectors with hundreds of client networks
                    to protect their network resources.

                        separate snapshot of the application, thus providing (automatic) escalation of the load-based
                        system, isolation of virtual customer access areas for greater security, and support for
                        multiple operating points to provide high availability.

                    Cytech will design and implement "Mobile ARTEMIS" - a mobile application of the system with an
                    emphasis on ease of use and its maintenance and support. Specifically, the application can be run on
                    mobile phones, adapted to the limitations of each mobile platform. It will work on both Android and
                    iOS devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, mechanisms will be developed to alert users in real-time (instant notification) of new
                    attacks, using mobile notification systems (SMS, push notifications, etc.). These mechanisms will
                    also work on parallel networks such as mobile networks. Using these alerts will allow network
                    administrators to quickly get basic information wherever they are, so if they want more information
                    they can use the ARTEMIS web application to deepen and take action to troubleshoot. The notification
                    system will ensure that the information being transmitted is not sensitive or is encrypted due to
                    security and privacy reasons.

                <p>Enartia will design and implement "ARTEMIS-as-a-service", a new cloud hosting service, which will
                    allow system users to access it from anywhere on the Internet without having to worry about security
                    issues or performance. Regarding the handling of sensitive data coming from the client network (such
                    as configuration files, data feeds), the client will be able to choose the location of the cloud
                    datacenter as well as whether all data will be encrypted. In this way, ARTEMIS-as-a-service will be
                    available as a service to companies that do not want to install any software in their internal
                    network or in cases where this process is expensive and time-consuming. Also, this service will be
                    useful to companies that want access to remote (e.g. on another continent) sources of BGP data
                    surveillance and network device configuration, since it will not require their physical presence
                    (e.g. dedicated rackspace), with the extra costs this involves.</p>
